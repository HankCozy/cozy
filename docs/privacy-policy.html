            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how Cozy Circle ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses,
                protects, and discloses information gathered from users ("you") of the Cozy Circle mobile
                application (the "App"). We are committed to maintaining your trust and ensuring the privacy of
                your data, especially sensitive data like voice recordings.

                    <strong>Crucial Assurance:</strong> We do not sell your Personal Data, and we do not use your data for

            <p>
                We use industry-standard security measures, including encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) and at

                However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.

            <h2>3. Third-Party Data Processors</h2>
            <p>
                We rely on external services solely to perform the core functions of the App. These parties act
                as our Service Providers and are contractually obligated to protect your data and only use it for
                the specific tasks we define.
            </p>

                <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> We use Supabase for database management and Railway for backend hosting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All third-party Service Providers are strictly prohibited from using your data for their own
                purposes, including training their own models or marketing.

                        <li><strong>How to Initiate Deletion:</strong> You can request account deletion directly within the App's Settings menu.</li>

            </ul>
